# MLOps Exercise: Medical Image Classification with Chest X-Ray Images

Welcome to our MLOps exercise, where we explore the fascinating world of Machine Learning Operations. In this project, we delve into the essential aspects of project organization and code development. Our primary focus is to ensure that each step in the MLops process is meticulously addressed.

## Objective

Our main goal in this exercise is to tackle a real-world medical challenge - diagnosing pneumonia. We do this by developing a model that classifies chest X-ray images into two categories: images of normal lungs and images depicting lungs with pneumonia.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this exercise, here are some prerequisites you should be familiar with:

- Basic understanding of Python.
- A grasp of fundamental machine learning concepts.
- Some experience with Jupyter Notebooks is beneficial.

## Tools and Libraries

We will be using a set of essential tools and libraries to accomplish our tasks, including:

- Flask
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- keras
- opencv-python

## Dataset

Our dataset contains a diverse collection of chest X-ray images. These images fall into two distinct categories:

- Chest X-ray images of healthy, normal lungs.
- Chest X-ray images that reveal lungs affected by pneumonia.

Let's embark on this exciting journey into the world of MLOps and medical image classification!
